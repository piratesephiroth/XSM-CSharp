description="A C# port of Etienne Blanc's XSM plugin. A personal implementation of StateCharts for Godot. This Extended State Machine provides easy to use timers and animations, simply by creating Nodes in Editor (composition). 
A basic platform example shows the true power of xsm!
Easy Node composition system, timers, animations, regions...

Now with a StateRoot, pending States, substates call, an active states list and arguments to a state_change, but also (NEW) a history of the active states"
